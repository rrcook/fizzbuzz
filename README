# fizzbuzz

A clojure fizzbuzz that puts the "fun" in functional. I wouldn't write it
this way for anything resembling production, it won't scale well much past
the hundreds, and I imagine the performance is bad, but it does do some
fun things like composing functions, using sets as predicate functions,
and taking advantage of clojure's dynamicness by sending a string into a set
full of numbers for a membership test.

## Usage

It's used to get past the first part of interviews.

## Installation

It's a Leiningen project. Just do 'lein swank' or whatever it is you use.
